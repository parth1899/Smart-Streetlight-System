# Smart-Streetlight-System

Developed a Smart Streetlight System which detects the presence of an incoming vehicle and increases the intensity of subsequent streetlights accordingly.

Streetlights are an essential part of all cities and the highways, that’s helpful to prevent accidents and unwanted thefts or robbery. Thousands of Street lights are installed beside the highways and the main roads. But the main problem is these streetlights consume about 25-30% of the total energy spent in the city. In this project, our main aim is to develop a “Smart Street light system” that will reduce electric power consumption. The normal streetlights always glow with high intensity, who consumes high electricity. But in the case of a smart streetlights system, it will glow with high intensity if there are vehicles or human movement on the road otherwise the lights will remain dim.
By using this system, we can save enough amount of electricity and of course money, this saved electricity can be used to lighten a few more homes in the rural areas.

*ANALYTICS*

Let us take the case of one of the longest highways, the NH48 (2807 km). It has a total of 56,000 Streetlights.

The average power rating of a streetlight is about 100W (say), and assume the streetlight to be on for 10 hours (7 pm to 5 am)

WHEN LIGHTS ARE AT FULL INTENSITY- The lights consume 5,600 kW-h of energy
In one night, 56,000 kW-h energy would be consumed.

WHEN LIGHTS ARE AT 15% INTENSITY- 

Let us assume that all the time periods when there are no vehicles on the road are combined to give 1 hour of vehicle free highway.
During this one hour, energy consumed = 56,000 * 15 / 1000 = 840 kW-h
During remaining nine hours, energy consumed is 56,000 * 100 * 9 / 1000 = 50,400 kW-h
Total consumed in this mode = 51,240 kW-h

Thus, Energy saved = 56,000 - 51,240 = 4760 kW-h (in just one day!)

For reference, Electrified households in larger states like Maharashtra, Gujarat, and Tamil Nadu, with higher rates of electrification, consume on an average a lower amount of about 80-90 units per month. 

Thus, the energy saved can power an average household for 60 days!
Average electricity demand of surveyed rural households is 39 kWh per month, which is half of the national average for residential consumption.
Here, the energy saved can be used to power a rural household for 120 days!
